# Rules for if-statements
# 1. Every if-statement must have an else.
# 2. If this else should never run because it doesnâ€™t make sense, then you must use a die function
# in the else that prints out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise. This
# will find many errors.
# 3. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
# 4. Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of
# sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
# 5. Your Boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables
# earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.from sys import exit

# Rules for Loops
# 1. Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never. This only applies to
# Python; other languages are different.
# 2. Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limited number
# of things to loop over
